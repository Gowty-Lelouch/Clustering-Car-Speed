For the calculation of Gear Ratio, the Vehicle is considered to be a Front Wheel Drive, with no propeller shaft. The RPM indicated on speedo is considered as Crankshaft RPM.

Tire Size considered = R14" - 165 / 80

side wall height = .80 * 165 = 132 mm

Rim diameter in mm = 355.6 mm

Total Tire diameter including side wall height = 487.6 mm

Speed (m/min) = wheel RPM * pi * wheel dia (meter)

wheel RPM = (3.14159 * .4876)/(speed *100 / 60)

Prop Shaft RPM = Wheel RPM * Final Drive (= 4.3288)

Gear Ratio = Engine RPM / Prop Shaft RPM

Gear Ratio is taken from the 'Props RPM.csv' file.

Average is taken as Gear Ratio (excluding some values due to noise, especially for first gear)

5th Gear = 0.517 : 1

4th Gear = 0.684 : 1

3rd Gear = 0.959 : 1

2nd Gear = 1.496 : 1

1st Gear = 3.2 : 1
